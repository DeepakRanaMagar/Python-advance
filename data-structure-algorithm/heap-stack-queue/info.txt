tree-based data structure, value of a parent node is ordered in a certain way with respect to the value of its child nodes.

Types: 
    Min heap(value of parent node is less than or equal to the its child)
    Max heap(value of parent node is greater than or equal to the its child)

Time complexity: O(logn)
